# Computer science

Material regarding my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science.
In this repo you can find some notes, always double check and don't trust them, there could be mistakes.

Below you can find the link to some projects I did for various courses.

## Bachelor

### 1 year
- [MIPS-multicycle-datapath](https://github.com/fdila/MIPS-multicycle-datapath): implementation of the MIPS multicycle datapath in Logisim Evolution. I actually made this project during my first Master's year, as part of my tutoring job for the course "**Architettura Degli Elaboratori**".

### 2 year
- [languages-and-computability](https://github.com/fdila/languages-and-computability-unimib): playing around with jflex and byaccj, assignments for the course "**Linguaggi e Computabilit√†**".
- [little-man-computer](https://github.com/fdila/little-man-computer): little man computer implementation in Prolog and LISP, for the course "**Linguaggi di Programmazione**".
- [brain-jobs](https://github.com/fdila/brain-jobs): small REST APIs in Java and ajax frontend. Made for the course "**Sistemi Distribuiti**".

### 3 year
- [bachelor-thesis](https://github.com/fdila/bachelor-thesis): my bachelor's thesis, working on microcontrollers to implement the control system for a differential drive robot.

## Master

### 1 year

- [exoplanet](https://github.com/derogab/exoplanet): project for the course "**Machine Learning**". Applying SVM, NN, and Naive Bayes models to predict if a exoplanet candidate will be classified as exoplanet.
- Assignments for the course "**Processo e Sviluppo Software**":
  - [pypeline](https://gitlab.com/fdila/2020_assignment1_pypeline): small Gitlab pipeline for Python projects.
  - [elicitation-strategy](https://gitlab.com/unishare/processo-e-sviluppo-del-software/2020_assignment2_elicitation_strategy): requirement elicitation, analysis and report.
  - [spring-paper](https://gitlab.com/unishare/processo-e-sviluppo-del-software/2020_assignment3_spring_paper): using Java with Spring framework for a small demo.
- [electronics-experimentations](https://github.com/fdila/electronics-experimentation): electronics lab, programming a microcontroller and experimenting with basic electronics circuits (e.g. OPAMPs). The course "**Esperimentazioni di Elettronica**" is actually part of the Physics Bachelor's, but I really liked the syllabus and I added it to my "piano studi".
- Projects for the course "**Metodi del Calcolo Scientifico**":
  - [linear-solver-comparison](https://github.com/fdila/linear-solver-comparison): comparison of linear solvers for sparse matrixes in MATLAB, Octave and Python.
  - [DCT-comparison-and-JPEG](https://github.com/fdila/DCT-comparison-and-JPEG): comparison of scipy dct vs. custom implemented dct and implementing a custom JPEG compression algorithm.
